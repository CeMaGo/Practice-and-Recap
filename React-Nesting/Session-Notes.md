# React Nesting

## Learning Objectives 

 - [ ] Understanding the concept of nesting
 - [ ] Creating multiple custom components to create a hierarchy 
 - [ ] Using `children` prop to render JSX from the parent component
 - [ ] Understandinfg composition as a way to built complex components

---

## Passing JSX as Props

ELements created by JSX are just objects. They can be passed around ;ike another object: for example, as props.

```js
function UserCard ( {avatar} ) {
    return <div className="card">{avatar}</div>;
}
```

```js
function App() {
    return <UseCard avatar = {<Avatar />} />
}
```

## The `children` Prop

You are already familiar with nesting built-in browser tage"

```js 
<div>
<imag/>
</div>
```
Oftentimes you'd want you own components to be nested as well.

```js
<UserCard>
    <Avatar/>
</UserCard>
```

If you nest a component inside of another components, the nested component is passed as a prop to the parent component. This special prop is called `cildren`.

```js
function UserCard ( {children} ){
    return <div className="card">{children}</div>;
}
```

This component will render the nested elemenet(s) as a child of the `div` element.

> ðŸ’¡ The nested element(s) can be a single element, multiple elements, or even a string or number.

## Fragments

Sometimes you want to return multiple elements from a component function without wrapping them in a `div` or other element. You can use a `Fragment` (`<></>` or `<Fragment></Fragment>`) for this.

This us necessary because React components can only return a single element from a component function.

```jsx
function UserList() {
    return (
        <>
        <UserCard>
         <Avatar />
        </UserCard>
        <UserCard>
         <Avatar />
        </UserCard>
        </>
    );
}
```

This is equivalent to the followung, but the shorthand version above is generally preferred.

```jsx
import {Fragment} from "react";

function UserList() {
    return (
        <Fragment>
        <UserCard>
         <Avatar />
        </UserCard>
        <UserCard>
         <Avatar />
        </UserCard>
        </Fragment>
    );
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ The `<Fragment></Fragment/>` syntax is only necessary if you want to pass teh special `key` prop to the fragment, which will become important when you start working with lists.
>
> ðŸ’¡ WHen researching you sometimes might see  `<React.Fragment></React.Fragment>`, which is the same thing.

## Composition

When we built Reacg applictaion, we odterm wannt to build complex components from simpler components. This is called compositions.

To do so you need to break down your applictaion into components. Ypu can the compose these components to built more complex components.

It is important to figure out which components you need and hoe they should be composed. This is called application design.
