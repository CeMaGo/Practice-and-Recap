## Arrays in JSX

to render elemenrs from an array in React we use array method `.map`

The array method `.map()` is used to apply a transformation to all items of an array. When rendering an array to JSX we are using `.map()`.

```js
function Drinks () {
    const drink = ["water", "lemonade", "coffee", "tea"];

    return (
        <ul>
        {drinks.map((drink) => (
            <li>{drink}</li>
    ))}</ul>
    );
}
```

# Key Propertz

The example above misses a tiny, but very important part: the `key` prop?!!!

Without the `key` prop you will see an error in the console:

> `Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop.`

WHen rendering an array in JSX you need to pass a **unique identifier** as value for the `key` prop of the first JSX tag returned in `.map()`. This is important for React to keep track of changes that happens to the data when re/rendering.

Therefore uou must always make sure your array contains a unique id per item. Zou can ensure this by using objects to define the data in your arrays. 

```js
function Drinks() {
    const drinks = [
        { id: 0, name: "water"},
        {id: 1, name: "lemonade "},
        {id: 2, name: "coffee"},
        {id: 3, name: "tea"},
    ];

return (
    <ul>
    {drink.map(({id, name}) => (
        <Drink key = {id} name{name} />
    ))}
    </ul>
);
}
```

If you want to access the `id` in this example you can pass it again as a prop:
> `<Drink key={id} id={id} name={name}/>`.

##Keyed Fragments

If you are rendering a list of items that are not wrapped in a single JSX tag, you can use a `<Fragment>` to wrap the item.

```js
import {Fragment} from "rect",

function Drink() {
     const drinks = [
        {id: 0, name: "water", description: "very wet"},
        {id: 1, name: "lemonade", description: "quite sweet"},
        {id: 2, name: "coffee", description: "cold brew"},
        {id: 3, name: "tea", description: "earl grey, hot"},
     ];

     return (
        <dl>
        {drinks.map(({id, name, description}) => (
            <Fragment key={id}>
            <dt>{name}</dt>
            <dd>{description}</dd>
            </Fragment>
     ))}
     </dl>
     );
}
```

> ðŸ’¡ Here you cannot use the short syntax (`<.>_</>`) for the `<Fragment>` because you need to pass the `key` prop to the `<Fragment>`. The short syntax does not allow to pass props.
